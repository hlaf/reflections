When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I can think of at least three situations in which it would be advantageous
    to use a remote repository. First, in the context of a team effort, such as
    a software project, where multiple people must work -- oftentimes
    concurrently -- on the same codebase.
    Second, when working on different computers, as in the case of
    multi-platform software development or remote work. Third, as a way to
    protect my work against data loss, by keeping a copy of the repository
    in a different physical location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
