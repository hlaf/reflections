When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I can think of at least three situations in which it would be advantageous
    to use a remote repository. The first, and perhaps the most frequent of
    these would be in the context of a team effort, such as a software
    development project, where multiple people work concurrently on the same
    codebase.
    Another use case would be when a person needs to work on different
    computers, as in the case of multi-platform software development or remote
    work.
    Finally, using a remote repository can also be a way to help protect one's
    work against data loss, by ensuring that at least one copy resides in a
    different physical location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
